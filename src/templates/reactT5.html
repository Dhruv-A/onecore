<h2 class="sub-head">5.1 What is the prop system</h2>
<p class="text-style">A system for passing data from a parent
   component to its children components. Its ultimate goal is to
   customise or configure a child component. e.g for each of
   the comment children, it can display different data for each
   child component which is unique but ultimately the same changes.</p>

<h2 class="sub-head">5.2 How does it work</h2>
<pre class="code-style"><code class="javascript">&lt;CommentDetail [name of prop] = "[value of prop]" /></code></pre>
<p class="text-style">This will give a unique value for each property of a child component.
  Now in the component we have to run the function as prop. For example:
  <pre class="code-style"><code class="javascript">const CommentDetail = props => {
  [also {props.author}]
}</code></pre>
  Essentially the props is a built-in javascript object which
  contains all the information that is passed from the parent.
</p>
<p class="text-style"><strong>Another way to communicate
   that information is using closing tags</strong>
   <pre class="code-style"><code class="javascript">&lt;ApprovalCard>[whatever inside here becomes a prop]&lt;/ApprovalCard></code></pre>
   If you console.log this youâ€™ll realise that the component becomes
   a prop with the property name of children so you can use this
   children property as display data within the content section of your
   Approval Card.</p>
