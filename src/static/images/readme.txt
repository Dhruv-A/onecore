This is just a teaching resource for my new program designed to get budding programmers into larger projects and to equip them with transferable skills in order to expose them to different implementations and applications of programming and creative-thinking!

Feel free to borrow anything of interest from here or contact me if you're interested in developing programming courses and need any help/advice.

Most of the stuff in here isn't going to be formatted logically because I use snippets of code from here at a time and there isn't much need for cohesion.

Make sure to join our discord server to join a community of both beginners and more experienced programmers!
