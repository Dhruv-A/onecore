<h1 class="about-title">Creating your own HTML files</h1>
<h2 class="sub-head">1. Downloading a text editor and flask</h2>
<p class="text-style">To run the website files, you will need to
   have a python IDE installed on your device. Ideally, this will
   be something with a text editor like atom so that you can do everything
   all in the same place. You can download atom
   <a class="link-style" href="https://atom.io/">here</a> and then install
   a package in it that lets you run python. You will also need to download
   python itself from
   <a class="link-style"href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">here</a>. Then,
   go to the command prompt and type in</p>
   <pre class="code-style"><code class="python">pip install flask</code></pre>
   <p class="text-style">This will install everything you need!</p>
<hr class="art-div">
<h2 class="sub-head">2. Downloading the website files</h2>
<p class="text-style">The last thing you'll need to download are the website
   files so that you can see exactly how your content will look. You just
   need to download this folder
   <a class="link-style"href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IYQVUmkL56fyzS7LiAVCifR_o8iSvVoI/view?usp=sharing">here</a>.
   Then open the folder in atom as a project folder and you can now get started!</p>
<hr class="art-div">
<h2 class="sub-head">3. Running the website</h2>
<p class="text-style">To run the website, go to the python file called main.py
   inside the folder you downloaded from the previous step. Leave it running
   and go to your browser and type in <em>http://localhost:5000</em>. Then
   click on the button that says <em>edit</em> on the navbar at the top.
   Whenever you code and refresh the browser, your changes will be visible here.</p>
<p class="text-style">Do not edit any of the files except <em>edit.html</em> which
   you will find inside the folder called <em>templates</em>. You put your HTML
   after the 3rd line, where it says to. After you start putting in HTML, save
   the html file (ctrl+s). Then, go to your browser and refresh the page from
   before. You should see all your changes pop up!</p>
<hr class="art-div">
<h2 class="sub-head">4. Headings</h2>
<p class="text-style">For the main heading at the top of the page, you
   use the following:</p>
<pre class="code-style"><code class="html">&lt;h1 class="top-head">Put heading here&lt;/h1></code></pre>

<p class="text-style">For the sub headings for sections, you
   use the following:</p>
<pre class="code-style"><code class="html">&lt;h2 class="sub-head">Put heading here&lt;/h2></code></pre>
<hr class="art-div">
<h2 class="sub-head">5. Text</h2>
<p class="text-style">For paragraphs of text, you
   use the following:</p>
<pre class="code-style"><code class="html">&lt;p class="text-style">Put text here&lt;/p></code></pre>
<p class="text-style">Use multiple of those for different paragraphs as it looks
   nicer than using &lt;br>:
<pre class="code-style"><code class="html">&lt;p class="text-style">This is one paragraph&lt;/p>
&lt;p class="text-style">This is another paragraph&lt;/p></code></pre>
<hr class="art-div">
<h2 class="sub-head">6. Code</h2>
<p class="text-style">For code, you
   use the following:</p>
<pre class="code-style"><code class="html">&lt;pre class="code-style">&lt;code class="python">Put code here&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></code></pre>
<p class="text-style">Change the word python in <em>class="python"</em> to the language you are using.
   For multiple lines of code, start on the same line as the opening tags, code as you normally would
   and finish on the same line as the closing tags:</p>
<pre class="code-style"><code class="html">&lt;pre class="code-style">&lt;code class="python">for i in range(10):
  print(i)
print('I am no longer in the for loop')&lt;/code>&lt;/pre></code></pre>
<hr class="art-div">
<h2 class="sub-head">7. Links</h2>
<p class="text-style">For links to something else, you
   use the following:</p>
<pre class="code-style"><code class="html">&lt;a class="link-style" href="https://websiteyouarelinkingto">Put text you want to click here&lt;/a></code></pre>
<hr class="art-div">
<h2 class="sub-head">8. Images</h2>
<p class="text-style">For images, you go to the <em>static</em> folder, and then
   the folder called <em>images</em>. Put your image in that, then
   use the following:</p>
<pre class="code-style"><code class="html">&lt;p>&lt;img src="{{ url_for('static', filename='images/imagename.png') }}"
     alt="This text will show up if image is not available"
     width=30% height=70% style="margin-left:12.5rem;"
     >&lt;/p></code></pre>
<p class="text-style">The only thing you need to change is to replace <em>imagename.png</em>
   with the name of your image. Do not remove or replace anything else unless you know
   what you're doing.</p>
<hr class="art-div">
<h2 class="sub-head">9. Extras</h2>
   <p class="text-style">Please let me know if you have any questions. Once your content
   is done, send me the whole edit.html file and then I'll upload it to the website!
   Then you can delete the stuff you put in edit.html so that the only stuff that's
   in there is:</p>
<pre class="code-style"><code class="python">{&#37; extends "baseedit.html" &#37;}
{&#37; block title &#37;}Title{&#37; endblock &#37;}
{&#37; block article &#37;}
Replace this text with your code...
{&#37; endblock &#37;}</code></pre>
<p class="text-style">Also, if you want to edit the stuff on the sidebar, you can
   do that by going to the <em>baseedit.html</em> file in <em>templates</em>.</p>
   In it, you can edit the things that say <em>1. Module 1</em> to whatever you wish!
   You can add more of these lesson cards whenever! However, don't worry about
   linking it to stuff (I'll handle all that). Make sure to let me know
   what you want the modules on your sidebar to be called so that I can make those
   changes!</p>
